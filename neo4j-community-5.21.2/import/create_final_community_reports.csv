The community revolves around the human brain, a significant organ in Homo sapiens, and its evolution in archaic humans. The brain's energy consumption and the impact on archaic humans' survival are the main factors connecting these entities.

## The human brain's energy consumption

The human brain, as represented by entity ID 72, accounts for 2-3% of total body weight but consumes 25% of the body's energy at rest. This significant energy consumption highlights the brain's importance in human physiology and behavior. [Data: Entities (72)]

## Archaic humans' large brains and consequences

Archaic humans, represented by entity ID 74, had larger brains that required more energy. This led to increased time spent searching for food and muscle atrophy. The relationship between archaic humans and the brain illustrates the trade-offs and challenges associated with large brain size. [Data: Entities (74), Relationships (44)]

## Homo sapiens and their large brains

Homo sapiens, represented by the relationship with ID 9, have a large brain that consumes a significant portion of the body's energy at rest.
