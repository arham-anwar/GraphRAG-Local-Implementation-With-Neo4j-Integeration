Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other\u2019s chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.\n\u201cNews?\u201d asked the taller of the two.\n\u201cThe best,\u201d replied Severus Snape.\nThe lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men\u2019s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.\n\u201cThought I might be late,\u201d said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. \u201cIt was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?\u201d\nSnape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men\u2019s way. Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke.\nThe yew hedges muffled the sound of the men\u2019s footsteps.
