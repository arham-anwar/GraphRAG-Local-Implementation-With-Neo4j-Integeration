Women who gave birth earlier, when the infants \nbrain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared \nbetter and lived to have more children. Natural selection \nconsequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed, compared \nto other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many \nof their vital systems are still underdeveloped. A colt can \ntrot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage \non its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are \nhelpless, dependent for many years on their elders for \nsustenance, protection and education. \n\nThis fact has contributed greatly both to humankind's \nextraordinary social abilities and to its unique social \nproblems. Lone mothers could hardly forage enough food for \ntheir o spring and themselves with needy children in tow. \n\nRaising children required constant help from other family \nmembers and neighbours. It takes a tribe to raise a human. \nEvolution thus favoured those capable of forming strong \nsocial ties. In addition, since humans are born \nunderdeveloped, they can be educated and socialised to a \nfar greater extent than any other animal.
