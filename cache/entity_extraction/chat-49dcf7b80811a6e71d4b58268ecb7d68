The earliest men and women, \n2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 600 cubic \n\n\n\ncentimetres. Modern Sapiens sport a brain averaging 1,200- \n1,400 cubic centimetres. Neanderthal brains were even \nbigger. \n\nThat evolution should select for larger brains may seem to \nus like, well, a no-brainer. We are so enamoured of our high \nintelligence that we assume that when it comes to cerebral \npower, more must be better. But if that were the case, the \nfeline family would also have produced cats who could do \ncalculus. Why is genus Homo the only one in the entire \nanimal kingdom to have come up with such massive \nthinking machines? \n\nThe fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. \nIt's not easy to carry around, especially when encased inside \na massive skull. It's even harder to fuel. In Homo sapiens , \nthe brain accounts for about 2-3 per cent of total body \nweight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body's energy \nwhen the body is at rest. \n\nBy comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per \ncent of rest-time energy.
