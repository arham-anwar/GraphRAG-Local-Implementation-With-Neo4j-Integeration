The story of these \nfundamental features of our universe is called physics. \n\nAbout 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and \nenergy started to coalesce into complex structures, called \natoms, which then combined into molecules. The story of \natoms, molecules and their interactions is called chemistry. \n\nAbout 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain \nmolecules combined to form particularly large and intricate \nstructures called organisms. The story of organisms is called \nbiology. \n\nAbout 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species \nHomo sapiens started to form even more elaborate \nstructures called cultures. The subsequent development of \nthese human cultures is called history. \n\nThree important revolutions shaped the course of history: \nthe Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 \nyears ago. The Agricultural Revolution sped it up about \n12,000 years ago. The Scienti c Revolution, which got under \nway only 500 years ago, may well end history and start \nsomething completely di erent. This book tells the story of \nhow these three revolutions have affected humans and their \nfellow organisms. \n\nThere were humans long before there was history.
