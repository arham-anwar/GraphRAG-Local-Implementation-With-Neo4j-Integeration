Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

There was nothing special about them. \n\nNobody, least of all humans themselves, had any inkling \nthat their descendants would one day walk on the moon, \nsplit the atom, fathom the genetic code and write history \nbooks.

Animals are said \nto belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each \nother, giving birth to fertile o spring. \n\nHorses and donkeys have a recent common ancestor and \nshare many physical traits. But they show little sexual \ninterest in one another. They will mate if induced to do so - \nbut their o spring, called mules, are sterile. Mutations in \ndonkey DNA can therefore never cross over to horses, or vice \nversa.
