These archaic humans loved, \nplayed, formed close friendships and competed for status \nand power - but so did chimpanzees, baboons and \nelephants. There was nothing special about them. \n\nNobody, least of all humans themselves, had any inkling \nthat their descendants would one day walk on the moon, \nsplit the atom, fathom the genetic code and write history \nbooks. The most important thing to know about prehistoric \nhumans is that they were insigni cant animals with no more \nimpact on their environment than gorillas, fireflies or \njellyfish. \n\nBiologists classify organisms into species. Animals are said \nto belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each \nother, giving birth to fertile o spring. \n\nHorses and donkeys have a recent common ancestor and \nshare many physical traits. But they show little sexual \ninterest in one another. They will mate if induced to do so - \nbut their o spring, called mules, are sterile. Mutations in \ndonkey DNA can therefore never cross over to horses, or vice \nversa. The two types of animals are consequently considered \n\n\n\ntwo distinct species, moving along separate evolutionary \npaths. By contrast, a bulldog and a spaniel may look very di \nerent, but they are members of the same species, sharing \nthe same DNA pool.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mixtral-8x7b-32768", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
