{"result": "Homo sapiens, also known as modern humans or simply Sapiens, is a species of the genus Homo and a member of the family of great apes. It is characterized by its large brain and high energy consumption at rest. Homo sapiens formed elaborate structures called cultures, leading to the development of history, and they are the species to which humans currently belong. As the species that includes wise men, Homo sapiens has kept a secret about its uncivilized cousins and former siblings. However, the future of Homo sapiens is uncertain, with experts suggesting that they may not survive for 2 million years, given the instability of their existence a thousand years from now.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
