ago from an earlier genus of apes called Australopithecus , 
which means 'Southern Ape'. About 2 million years ago, 
some of these archaic men and women left their homeland 
to journey through and settle vast areas of North Africa, 
Europe and Asia. Since survival in the snowy forests of 
northern Europe required di erent traits than those needed 
to stay alive in Indonesia's steaming jungles, human 
populations evolved in di erent directions. The result was 
several distinct species, to each of which scientists have

On the island of Java, in Indonesia, lived Homo soloensis, 
'Man from the Solo Valley', who was suited to life in the 
tropics. On another Indonesian island - the small island of 
Flores - archaic humans underwent a process of dwar ng. 
Humans rst reached Flores when the sea level was 
exceptionally low, and the island was easily accessible from 
the mainland. When the seas rose again, some people were 
trapped on the island, which was poor in resources. Big 
people, who need a lot of food, died rst. Smaller fellows 
survived much better. Over the generations, the people of 
Flores became dwarves. This unique species, known by

only one metre and weighed no more than twenty- ve

The Cost of Thinking 

Despite their many di erences, all human species share 
several de ning characteristics. Most notably, humans have 
extraordinarily large brains compared to other animals. 
Mammals weighing sixty kilograms have an average brain 
size of 200 cubic centimetres. The earliest men and women, 
2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 600 cubic 



centimetres. Modern Sapiens sport a brain averaging 1,200- 
1,400 cubic centimetres. Neanderthal brains were even 
bigger.

It's not easy to carry around, especially when encased inside 
a massive skull. It's even harder to fuel. In Homo sapiens , 
the brain accounts for about 2-3 per cent of total body 
weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body's energy 
when the body is at rest. 

By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per 
cent of rest-time energy. Archaic humans paid for their large 
brains in two ways. Firstly, they spent more time in search of 
food. Secondly, their muscles atrophied. Like a government 
diverting money from defence to education, humans 
diverted energy from biceps to neurons. It's hardly a 
foregone conclusion that this is a good strategy for survival 
on the savannah. A chimpanzee can't win an argument with 
a Homo sapiens , but the ape can rip the man apart like a rag 
doll. 

Today our big brains pay o nicely, because we can produce 
cars and guns that enable us to move much faster than 
chimps, and shoot them from a safe distance instead of 
wrestling. But cars and guns are a recent phenomenon. For 
more than 2 



million years, human neural networks kept growing and

humans can perform very intricate tasks with their hands. In 
particular, they can produce and use sophisticated tools. 

The rst evidence for tool production dates from about 2.5 

million years ago, and the manufacture and use of tools are 
the criteria by which archaeologists recognise ancient 
humans. 

Yet walking upright has its downside. The skeleton of our 
primate ancestors developed for millions of years to support 
a creature that walked on all fours and had a relatively small 
head. Adjusting to an upright position was quite a challenge, 
especially when the sea olding had to support an extra-large 
cranium. 

Humankind paid for its lofty vision and industrious hands

space came into being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these 
fundamental features of our universe is called physics. 

About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and 
energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called 
atoms, which then combined into molecules. The story of 
atoms, molecules and their interactions is called chemistry. 

About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain 
molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate 
structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called 
biology. 

About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species 
Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate 
structures called cultures. The subsequent development of 
these human cultures is called history. 

Three important revolutions shaped the course of history: 
the Cognitive Revolution kick-started history about 70,000 
years ago. The Agricultural Revolution sped it up about 
12,000 years ago. The Scienti c Revolution, which got under 
way only 500 years ago, may well end history and start 
something completely di erent. This book tells the story of 
how these three revolutions have affected humans and their 
fellow organisms.

There were humans long before there was history. Animals 
much like modern humans rst appeared about 2.5 million

out from the myriad other organisms with which they shared 
their habitats. 

On a hike in East Africa 2 million years ago, you might well 
have encountered a familiar cast of human characters: 
anxious mothers cuddling their babies and clutches of 
carefree children playing in the mud; temperamental youths 
cha ng against the dictates of society and weary elders who 
just wanted to be left in peace; chest-thumping machos 
trying to impress the local beauty and wise old matriarchs 
who had already seen it all. These archaic humans loved,

and power - but so did chimpanzees, baboons and

impact on their environment than gorillas, fireflies or 
jellyfish. 

Biologists classify organisms into species. Animals are said 
to belong to the same species if they tend to mate with each 
other, giving birth to fertile o spring. 

Horses and donkeys have a recent common ancestor and 
share many physical traits. But they show little sexual 
interest in one another. They will mate if induced to do so - 
but their o spring, called mules, are sterile. Mutations in 
donkey DNA can therefore never cross over to horses, or vice 
versa. The two types of animals are consequently considered 



two distinct species, moving along separate evolutionary 
paths. By contrast, a bulldog and a spaniel may look very di 
erent, but they are members of the same species, sharing 
the same DNA pool.""",300,['f9cfdecbdc76299fdf0b3a6662b81097'],"['d91a266f766b4737a06b0fda588ba40b' 'bc0e3f075a4c4ebbb7c7b152b65a5625'

extraordinarily large brains compared to other animals. 
Mammals weighing sixty kilograms have an average brain 
size of 200 cubic centimetres. The earliest men and women, 
2.5 million years ago, had brains of about 600 cubic 



centimetres. Modern Sapiens sport a brain averaging 1,200- 
1,400 cubic centimetres. Neanderthal brains were even 
bigger. 

That evolution should select for larger brains may seem to 
us like, well, a no-brainer. We are so enamoured of our high 
intelligence that we assume that when it comes to cerebral 
power, more must be better. But if that were the case, the 
feline family would also have produced cats who could do 
calculus. Why is genus Homo the only one in the entire 
animal kingdom to have come up with such massive 
thinking machines? 

The fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. 
It's not easy to carry around, especially when encased inside 
a massive skull. It's even harder to fuel. In Homo sapiens , 
the brain accounts for about 2-3 per cent of total body 
weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body's energy 
when the body is at rest. 

By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per 
cent of rest-time energy. Archa""",300,['f9cfdecbdc76299fdf0b3a6662b81097'],"['96aad7cb4b7d40e9b7e13b94a67af206' '32e6ccab20d94029811127dbbe424c64'

Today our big brains pay o nicely, because we can produce 
cars and guns that enable us to move much faster than 
chimps, and shoot them from a safe distance instead of 
wrestling. But cars and guns are a recent phenomenon. For 
more than 2 



million years, human neural networks kept growing and 
growing, but apart from some int knives and pointed sticks, 
humans had precious little to show for it. 

What then drove forward the evolution of the massive 
human brain during those 2 

million years? Frankly, we don't know. 

Another singular human trait is that we walk upright on two 
legs. Standing up, it's easier to scan the savannah for game 
or enemies, and arms that are unnecessary for locomotion 
are freed for other purposes, like throwing stones or 
signalling. The more things these hands could do, the more 
successful their owners were, so evolutionary pressure 
brought about an increasing concentration of nerves and 
nely tuned muscles in the palms and ngers. As a result, 
humans can perform very intricate tasks with their hands. In 
particular, they can produce and use sophisticated tools. 

The rst evidence for tool production dates from about 2.5 

million years ago, and the manufacture and use of tools are 
the criteria by which archaeologists recognise ancient 
humans.
